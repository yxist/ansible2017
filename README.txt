I wrote this in 2016-2017 to learn ansible.
I didn't test it since then and it probably doesn't work anymore.

It was meant to:
 1. bootstrap a raw freshly installed minimal system
    - installing basic ansible dependencies
    - setup an ansible user with an autogenerated password
    - add the login information to host_vars (this way we didn't need them in the inventory)
    - add the (autogenerated) sudo password to ansible vault
 2. setup the system
    - configure repositories
    - install packages
 3. configure every user according to config as in playbooks/host_vars/EXAMPLE/users.yml
    - this was mostly to configure color schemes consistently (terminal, vim, i3, etc.)
 4. work under fedora, centos and debian

You would use it by:
 1. adding a system to the bootstrap inventory
 2. adding it to known_hosts using scripts/add_known_host.sh
 3. running ./scripts/bootstrap.sh
 4. once it was properly setup for ansible add the host to the main inventory
 5. configuring users as in playbooks/host_vars/EXAMPLE/users.yml
